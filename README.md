# Philly Concert Finder

A simple, clean application to find upcoming concerts at the best venues in Philadelphia. Easily find shows, listen to artists, and directly buy tickets.

## Motivation

Existing concert applications were cluttered with unnecessary shows, features, and locations. I wanted an easy way to view the shows at the top venues. Viewing dozens of shows for one night at small venues made it difficult to focus on the top venues and artists.

## Built With

This web application was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I pulled the data from the SongKick API, and used YouTube as the music search engine.
